Ori and the Blind Forest / Ori and the Will of the Wisps
crossover pack.

[b]If you experience crash at startup with something about "method which doesn't exist in any base class", 
make sure that AnimLib is 0.3+ version (as for OriMod 3.2), if it isn't try restarting the game, 
if it doesn't update it, try deleting it through mod management, closing the game, 
unsubscribing from OriMod and AnimLib, then resubscribing to them, 
making sure that game have downloaded these mods (~8mb download) and then launching the game again, should help.[/b]

--- Summary ---

To start, craft a Spirit Sprout using 10 wood and either one
enchanted weapon (sword, boomerang, arkhalis), or three basic
movement items (bottle items, climbing items, or basic boots not
including rocket), then place it and right click on it.

Sein will assist you on your journey. At the Spirit Sprout, use 8
Silver or Tungsten. As you continue your adventure, Sein will
have the opportunity to grow stronger with you. To do this,
upgrade the Spirit Orb using various materials.

Unlock and upgrade various abilities by creating
Spirit Medallions. These Medallions are created at the
Spirit Sprout, and new ones will become available throughout
your journey.

Microsoft owns all property to Ori. The creators of this mod
simply loved Ori and we wanted to make it work in Terraria.

If you enjoy this mod, we encourage you to play
Ori and the Blind Forest, and Ori and the Will of the Wisps.
